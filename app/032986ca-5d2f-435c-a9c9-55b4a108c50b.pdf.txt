Zelenskiy asks gathering of European
leaders for security guarantees

Ukrainian president addresses first meeting of the European
Political Community in Prague attended by leaders of 44 countries

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has appealed to European leaders across the
continent for security guarantees in support of his bid to join Nato, as he described Russia as

“the most anti-European state in the world”.

Addressing leaders attending the first meeting of the European Political Community, a
gathering that brought together almost every nation on the continent except Russia and

Belarus, Zelenskiy urged them to support Ukraine in their own self-interest.

Most states would not be able to wage such an intense war, so the conflict must be won in
Ukraine, he told the leaders via video link. “So that Russian tanks do not advance on Warsaw
or again on Prague. So that Russian artillery does not fire at the Baltic states. So that Russian

missiles do not hit the territory of Finland or any other country.”

While the EPC was initially intended to unite Europe’s democracies, many would challenge
that label when applied to attenders, such as Turkey and Azerbaijan, both rated as “not free”
by the NGO Freedom House. EU member state Hungary was recently declared “a hybrid

regime of electoral autocracy” by the European parliament.

Latvia’s prime minister, Krisjanis Karins, conceded that “the internal vivacity ... of

democracy varies across Europe”, adding he did not want to whitewash the issue. Speaking

to the Guardian, he said all participating countries could be described as nation states, while

Russia viewed itself as an empire.

“The conversation is made difficult by conflicts and very real conflict within other parts of
Europe as well, but that does not mean all of us cannot actively condemn Russia’s aggression

an outright war and what appears to be genocide.”

The EU has organised the first meeting, but officials have tried to take a step back to avoid

the impression of creating an anteroom to EU membership.

One EU official suggested the participation of former Soviet countries Azerbaijan and
Armenia — whose troops continue to fight over their frontier —- showed the added value of the
meeting, saying these countries were “sometimes considered as Moscow’s back yard” so their

participation was “of geopolitical importance”.

The official also said there would be a request to non-EU partners to align on sanctions
against Russia, although other sources downplayed the likelihood of pressure being exerted
at the summit. Neither Turkey, which has sought to be a mediator in the Russia-Ukraine war,
nor Serbia, a candidate to join the EU with historical ties to Moscow, has signed up to EU

sanctions.
